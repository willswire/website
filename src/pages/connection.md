After finishing Thanksgiving dinner, my dad and I turned on the Baltimore Ravens football game.

Within the first ten minutes of the game starting, an ad started playing with Bob Dylan's raw vocals lilting over [_Girl from the North Country_](https://www.google.com/search?q=Girl+from+the+North+Country) in the background. 

"A little connection goes a long way". The ad was for [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/facebook/videos/a-little-connection-goes-a-long-way/1212985850754004/).

Advertisement or advisement? 

Maybe the contrapositive is true. Maybe "a lot of connection goes a short way," or maybe even "too much connection goes nowhere at all."
