There are too many process people. Don't get me wrong - there's a time and place for organizing, improving, and articulating process, but it must come after content. Otherwise, there's nothing concrete to "point at" - there is no external reality which collides with each of our own perceptions and assumptions.

This is why I love the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For organizations who aren't producing product, I like to think of how I can contribute to Minimum Viable Change (MVC). What action can I do right now, outside (or in spite) of the established process, to deliver the most conspicuous impact? I want to produce a "what" before I begin spending time to improve the "how”.

These are just some thoughts that come to mind after watching [Steve Jobs in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4dCJJFuMsE), where he shares his firmly held belief that Content > Process.
